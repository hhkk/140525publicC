            Commands are function names that you submit along with records, to indicate how to use or update that
            record.
            Special character codes and sequences that you enter, or that exist in records, are in records as having
            special meaning.
            Use of special commands and syntax is optional and will not apply to all records. Commands and syntax are
            also menu-selectable.

            <br>
            Tags and Categories are an index into activities such as: find information, deep-link to the web, process
            email, open a folder on your local machine.
            Tags and categories can be re-used across records to save keystrokes.

            In addition to various utilities like maintaining search and browse history,
            email processing automation and messaging primary functions of UsToDo (we have IMAP support including Gmail
            labels).
            For most of us, our inbox is a wide assortment of emails, from an unclassified set of senders, and it is
            difficult to separate important from unimportant emails.

            Important messages are sometimes missed, and one by one you must consider every email and to decide if and
            how to act and whether now or later.
            The UsToDo email interpreter is a set of functions to help you navigate the stream of email you receive or
            send,
            providing tools for email filtering, email pointers, and email content indexing.
            The idea behind email automation is both to integrate email messages and words and senders into the larger
            context of your life.
            "create calendar event" or "folders/labels" that email tools like Outlook and Gmail provide.
            In a sense, UsToDo combines multiple user experiences and web interactions into one, as
            you are at once in a browser, sending email, interacting with calendar, conversing with other individuals.

            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to email, you can search, create, share, categorize, track, visualize, go to, or update/write
            your digital objects and electronic resources such as:

            Catalogs all your data, metadata, and data sources into one space across: accounts, contacts, calendar,

            Related services include: Clipix, Evernote, OneNote, Zetera. These services allow you to clip and save,
            whereas UsToDo is addressing
            the larger framework of your life including external scheduling, communications, and commitments, e.g.,
            coupling to email and workflows


            <br>UsToDo.com is a text and forms database with simple but powerful touch-points to help you to
            clip, categorize, prioritize, track, browse, and go to all of your
            electronic artifacts:
            accounts, data, documents, emails, events, folders, links, numbers, notes, movies, steps, stickies,
            thoughts, websearch, etc.
            An integration point and workflow minimization tool for your web and computer interactions.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>
            The system has several pieces: 1) a web app, 2) a browser plugin, 3) a smartphone app, and 4) email & text
            messaging
            for input and reminders. (Items 1 and 4 are currently implemented in prototype.)
            Use text records (and largely text-keyboard-based interactions) to save tidbits, manage personal information
            and calendars, launch apps and links,
            maintain search/browse history, and help organize and process email (email management is one of the primary
            applications in UsToDo).
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schedule. Organize. Message. Execute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <br>
            <br>
            UsToDo records are, at root, simply time-stamped text. Records can be queried with full substring search.
            Records usually include tags and categories as an index, and contain clickable links to web sites, to
            open/run local computer
            folders-files-commands, or to individual (e.g., categorized) email messages.
            Users can structure text records in any way and use regular expressions to find records of particular
            structure or value.
            Tag and category management tools...
            JSON document format is supported enabling structured database features, forms, and document database query
            including topic and regular expression filters.
            <br>
            <br>
            A customizable set of Commands can be embedded in the text (or selected from a menu) to invoke specific
            UsToDo actions such as:
            'QuickLink' to external a web page and
            'QuickSearch' into external apps like Amazon, Bing, Email, Ebay, Evernote, Facebook, Google, Maps, Netflix,
            Weather, Yelp, Zappos, etc.
            Share or publish associated records to individuals or groups.
            A set of records can be exported and re-imported after editing with more traditional document editors such
            as Word or Google Docs.

            UsToDo is also a messaging and sharing platform. Sharing and publishing can be applied to tags and
            categories as well as to individual records.
            Emails and text messages can be sent, triggered, or scheduled under various conditions to facilitate
            individual effort, joint authorship,
            group research, or team process.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The UsToDo.com platform is a database and workflow engine and supports end-user programming.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond passive search, UsToDo can be used to guide and prompt as to what deserves your
            attention at a point in time, leveraging: 1) recent categories written to, 2) recent searches across web
            sites including searches of the
            ustodo record store (a research tracking feature),
            3) recently viewed or altered records, and 4) defined priorities and to do's. Alert based on schedules or
            dependencies that you are responsible for an action.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The browser interface is implemented in Groovy on Grails and is currently optimized for the
            Google Chrome browser.

            Let's face it, our brains are often fragmented, interrupted, and multitasking.
            Our enjoyment and efficiency in life depend, in part, to our ability to manage
                our attention across may projects and tasks in life, and to manage the information
                associated with the increasing electronic world we spend our time in.
            We offer UsToDo as a cognitive ...  attention manager, executive function.
