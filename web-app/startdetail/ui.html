            When we have to pick an application before we can start typing, the spontenaity is lost.
            Ubiquity.  Embedded.  Within the current workflow.

            The set of commands is extensible -> programming environment.


            <br>
            <br>
            USER INTERFACE#1 the WEB
            The web application allows you to search and create and organize records.
            The tab orientation of a browser gives you multiuple simultaneous "thought streams".
            The title of the tab is the current contents of UsToDo.com's one and only text input field
            Reuse of prior records - last search key or category.
            Reuse address bar contents - not a copy paste - just add words and a w.
            a dashboard view for all of your instantaneous context rapid proprities scheduler.
            Panels can divide the screen into on a dashboard are constantly shifting reflecting your changing mental focus.
            <br>
            Tabs are an important part of the web interface.
            <br>
            Tags are words and phrases, separated by the character sequence " / ".

            <br>
            Speedy retrieval, navigation, and visualization of your own keywords --> full interaction with the web interface, mind-computer meld rapid browsing of contexts, much like thought itself.
            So basically UsToDo web app is an interactive rapid parallel thinking and remembering process.
            Lookahead on words.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Cognition
            Each panel or tab represents a different thought or activity stream.
            <br>
            <br>
            USER INTERFACE#2 the BROWSER
            The browser address bar doubles as a data entry field.
            So you can type commands into the browser address bar.
            (mouse-less operation, double-purposing the browser address bar)
            Or 'ctrl-L' to your browser command line and invoke a web or email search, or create a new record.   {little software development needed, plugins}



            <BR>
            THe two input fields (browser address bar and UsToDo command have identical behavior. Each can be used for the traditional role of brining up a web page.  But doubles as a text line input.
            <br>
            <br>
            USER INTERFACE#3: EMAIL:
            <br>
            <br>
            USER INTERFACE#4: SMS:
            For example, speak into your phone via text messaging, and seconds later that record has been transcribed into UsToDo.

            consider table UI x read-v-write x

            <br>
            <br>
            SEARCH/INDEX:
            UsToDo supports multiple search and indexing schemes over text records, and over the underlying content behind links contained within the text records.
            For ustodo records themselves, full substring search is supported.
            By default, search queries to the system return records as most-recent-first.
            A taxonomic structure...
            Full query<br>
            Full programming language<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            MESSAGING / VIRAL / SHARED SPACE:
            Share or publish associated records to individuals or groups.
            Sharing and publishing can be applied to tags and categories as well as to individual records.
            messaging and Messaging happens through text (sms) as well as email
            Unlike most network messaging platforms,
            It doesn't take most user's long to begin messaging and scheduling others via ustodo.
            For this reason, UsToDo is a viral sharing platform.
            UsToDo value start at the individual level and then, for his or her own convenience, others are pulled in.
            Meaning the network had value to the first user - not typical.
            Individual adoption and grows by necessity.

            <br>
            <br>
            META-DOC:  Data with common tags and categories can be thought of as being in an UsToDo document.
            It is in this sense a document management system.
            A single record may be in multiple UsToDo documents.  UsToDo documents can be export-imported to editors like Google Docs and Word.

            in personal data and information modeling
            <br>
            <br>
            As for privacy - though you can click and deep-link to your personal email and web pages via UsToDo, there is no need to provide any passwords, and the ustodo system
            requires no access to email contents for some email functions including search.  Searches of email are through search-connectors.
            Only for rich email integration, an optional feature, do you need to allow UsToDo access to any user/password data.

            <br>across data sets, and across applications, and across document repositories - integration articulation
            <br>
            Data and metadata in the same string.
            <br>
            <br>
            INDEX/QUERY/SEMANTICS (CATEGORY/PRIORITY/TIME):
            By default, UsToDo offers a temporal view of data.
            The index is rich because pointer and title are joined with my keywords as first class data objects.
            UsToDo records contain both tag/category metadata as well as the reference in the same index space.
            Records can be queried by substring and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression>regular expressions</a> to find records of particular structure or value.

            Because all information is bridged through a common and shared user interface, we believe some interesting opportunities
            arise for information and shedule sharing.

            Combining commands with text and metadata makes UsToDo a single point of entry and organization - a gateway to your web and computer activities,
            from launching apps to online research and shopping, to sending email and scheduling reminders.

            <br>
            <br>
            What we do is to highlight and organize across all the applications - what should get your attention, AND it puts records from multiple sources into one organization scheme.

            The word and string space is highly indexed in the sense that ... substring ... temporal ... graph structure view ... priority hierarchy / tag-relevance manipulations
            UsToDo leverages the infrastructure of its underlying technologies
            by exposing them.  No development API needed, just add data and logic.

            <br>
            <br>
            PLANS:
            (Plans include <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/lifelines/"> visualization</a> of tags, categories, and record sets,
            e.g., word-clouds and <a href="http://iihm.imag.fr/publs/2006/RevI3_DaassiNigayFauvet.pdf")>time</a> Alert based on schedules or dependencies that you are responsible for an action.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The UsToDo web app UI is implemented in Groovy on Grails optimized for the Google Chrome browser.

            <br>Sample tag lines:
            <br>Attention Manager.
            <br>Executive Function.
            <br>Automate your life.
            <br>Personal workflow engine.
            <br>Your mind in a database.
            <br>A resting place and productivity space for mind, data, fingers.

            &nbsp;Organize. Share. Message. Check.
            <br>
            <br>
            PROGRAMMABILITY/API:
            Data structure and algorithm both.  A programming language generator.
            The UsToDo.com platform is a database and workflow engine and supports end-user programming.
            JSON document format is supported enabling structured database features, forms, and document database query.
            (Chrome browser best: The web implementation has several configuration options that work only on the chrome browser.)
            UsToDo is also a functional programming language in that its data objects are executable within an UsToDo programming environment and data set.

            <br>Unified digital objects.
            <br>A programming and hosting environment.

            <br>
            This ability to intermingle local with remote records in a unified index structure ....


            <br>
            Underlying database and programming environment can be exposed, so the system remains very flexible {virtual machines},
            so that it can be multipurpose and thus can support development of apps on it.  Can also have a personal microcloud for ultimate privacy comfort-level.
            API's are optional and can be part of apps built.  Define a query and function. HotLink as an example of a user-developed feature.
            <br>
            <br>
            Connectors are interfaces to external web sites.  'Search/bounce to' is a connector type.
            <br>
            (though use of tags or any other suggested methods depends on individual preference)
            <br>
            Records export-import with Google Docs and Word.
